# horiseon-refactor-homework
## Description

I built this project because it needed to be refactored. My goal was to make this website more accessible. The website is more organized and removed pointless code. This also helps any future coder who wants to change or improve the website because of the semantic elements I added and how I organized my CSS. From this project I learned that using semantic elements is better than using div when creating my HTML. When I added to semantic elements, it was easy to follow whenever I made changes. In CSS, I learned to not repeat yourself and how to target specific elements. When I started this project, I deleted some code because I thought it was pointless since I didn't see any changes when I deleted it. Later, I realized that the code I deleted did matter, so I learned to not delete anything right away even if it seems pointless to have.
